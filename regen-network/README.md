The Goal of the **Regen Network** community is to build **foundational fintech infrastructure for ecological claims and data**.

This means serving as the ‘Layer 0’ upon which other projects and protocols may build upon and harness to execute their own climate-focused business models. Using a distributed ledger and modern remote sensing technology, the Regen Network team is creating new tools for how humanity relates to its environment.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Context

Blockchain and crypto driven innovation, as well as the hi-tech space in general, have not yet established a coherent relationship with the biosphere. One of the highest potential uses of blockchain-enabled decentralized governance, crypto-economics, and distributed computing is to bring forth a game-changing paradigm shift in the **relationship between financial systems and ecosystem health**.

This whitepaper outlines how a **tokenized distributed ledger** running **decentralized protocols for the verification of ecological outcomes** and smart contracting capacity can enable numerous industries (from carbon markets, to consumer product companies, to the insurance sector) to tie their decision-making back to an accurate shared understanding of their impact on natural systems.

### 1.2. The Potential of Blockchain in Service to Ecosystem Health

Soil is the foundation of the health of our economy and the health of the world. Our current degenerative global agricultural system results in 75 billion tons of topsoil loss per year through erosion. This has an estimated cost of $400 billion to farmers and society. In addition, agriculture currently releases up to 12 gigatons of CO2 equivalent per year, with the food system as a whole releasing up to 16.9 gigatons per year.

At the same time, **agriculture holds the potential to become a massive net carbon sink**, sequestering billions of tons of CO2 per year into the world's soils and above-ground biomass. **Land stewardship** (farming, ranching, forestry) as well as **ocean management** (fisheries and mariculture) are the key intervention points to reverse these flows of carbon.

There is considerable consumer interest in taking our planet into account (as shown by the growing market power of labels like "organic", "eco", "green", etc.), but these market-led efforts have mostly failed to create significant change. There's also a growing governmental mandate to address systemic environmental and climate change issues, yet none of these efforts add up to a coordinated or adequate response to our current existential crisis. **We need to explicitly track the ecological impacts of our actions right alongside the financial**.

Taking a decentralized approach to this aim requires an ecosystem of organizations, each with their own important role.
- **Regen Foundation** will spearhead the **scientific research and infrastructure development** necessary to create transparent and open Ecological State Protocols.
- **Regen Consortium and the Community Staking Pools** will act as the **democratic body that stewards the ledger** and the cultural shift towards true-cost accounting, creating a culture of collaboration towards building the infrastructure needed to bring Earth's needs into our collective awareness and capacity for action.
- **Regen Ledger** will be the domain-specific blockchain acting as the transparent balance sheet for Earth.

### 1.3. Regen Ledger: Balance Sheet for Earth

For market-driven solutions to achieve regenerative outcomes, **full ecological accounting** must be available for the private and public sectors. 

By tokenizing the common asset or infrastructure upon which economically generative (and in the case of Regen Network, ecologically regenerative) applications can be built, it becomes possible to make the evolution and development of this core infrastructure not only viable, but attractive to both developers and funders.

Regen Ledger's native token, $REGEN, will offer the ability to collaborate to build information technology infrastructure to account for ecological value.

## 2. System Architecture

![Regen Network System Architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81234139/170972908-aca8f57f-335f-4362-88cf-53b4c547a1b7.png)

The core attributes of Regen Ledger's design, and indeed the aim of the larger Regen Network community, is the ability to **use smart contracting capacity to reward ecological regeneration**. The system architecture outlined in this document illustrates the most expedient way to create a system for trusted attestations of ecological state based on verifiable ecological data.

### 2.1. Ecological Protocol Frameworks

Regen Ledger provides three core ecological protocol frameworks:

- **Ecological State Protocols (ESPs)** define the algorithms and conditions necessary to verify a certain state or change of state on a piece of land.
- **Ecological Contracts (ECs)** allow us to fund and reward desired change in ecological state.
- **Supply Protocols (SPs)** allow us to tie ecological state into supply chains in trusted ways.

#### 2.1.1. Ecological State Protocols (ESPs)

An ESP specifies algorithms and criteria needed to verify a certain ecological state or change of state. A single protocol produces a boolean (yes/no) or numeric result representing the calculated ecological change of state.

**Examples:**
- A score on a scale from 0-10 representing suitability of a piece of land as endangered species habitat.
- The number of tons of carbon sequestered on a given piece of land in a given time frame into soil and/or above ground biomass.
- Verification of increase in biodiversity of insects, birds or plant life.
- A boolean value representing whether a piece of land has sufficient groundwater holding capacity to prevent flooding within a given range of rainfall.

The basic function of an ESP is simply **evaluating state and change of state for a specified area**. This can generally be done without actually knowing who is the rightful land owner or steward if reliable, geo-tagged data is available. One compelling application of ESPs is using them as a class of decentralized digital certification (like Organic or Fair Trade), with the goal of promoting good land use practices. In order to link the outcome of an ESP to a land steward's identitiy, a **Land Tenure Verification Protocol (LTVP)** will need to be run.

Each ESP is managed by a curating organization that can upgrade existing ESPs with new versions as improvements to the underlying algorithms are made.

#### 2.1.2. Ecological Contracts (ECs)

Ecological Contracts (ECs) allow for trusted funding and/or incentivization of specific ecological outcomes.

**Examples:**
- An organization that wants to issue rewards for a specific level of carbon seuqestration in a certain region.
- A community group that wants to both solicit funds and have them directed to appropriate landowners to support endangered species habitat in a region.
- A landowner that wants to request funds to support them to achieve a specific ecological outcome.

The EC platform is primarily a smart contract framework for crowdfunding positive ecological change. However, in order to achieve this capability, we must also achieve smart contracting capabilities that make it possible to write ECs for reparations when damage to ecosystems is generated through activity. In addition to monetary exchange dependent on ecological state, other smart contract terms could be used including ownership, governance, and special rights dependent upon a given verifiable change in ecological state.

An EC is first and foremost constructed using **phases**. Each phase represents a logical progression in the contract process. The successful completion of each
phase is necessary to proceed to later stages, and each stage may or may not involve financial rewards.

ECs will generally **reference one or more ESPs** and may set thresholds for ESPs with scalar results (e.g., greater than 5 on the biodiversity index). The results of an ESP may also be used to scale reward amounts. ECs may also include other criteria such as submitting plain language text or photos to be reviewed by a specific trusted third party, as well as minimum thresholds for land tenure verification.

ECs define three distinct roles: **funders, land stewards, and curators**. The **curator** is always the party that has created the EC, which can also be the land steward or a funder:
- If a land steward creates an EC, then it works somewhat like a traditional crowdfunding system where a land steward is requesting donations.
- A funder, such as a private foundation, may create an EC to solicit various land stewards to apply for grants from its funds.
- An entity which is neither a land steward nor a funder could also start an EC to solicit both funders and land stewards as participants.

#### 2.1.3. Supply Protocols (SPs)

Regen Ledger will have basic features to support supply tracking as well as a Supply Protocol (SP) framework that allows for more sophisticated assessment of verified ecological supply. The Supply Protocol framework will build on top of the Ecological State Protocol (ESP) framework and allow for algorithms to be specified in a similar manner, but that take supply chain tracking data as input in addition to land use data.

### 2.2. Network Components

#### 2.2.1. Regen Ledger

**Regen Ledger** is a domain-specific, **public blockchain built on top of the Tendermint consensus engine**. It is built with the assumption that the most secure
way to support its target functionality is through domain-specific frameworks first and full-fledged programming languages second.

### 2.3. Data

In order to triangulate and create **assurance of accuracy**, as well as **deter gaming** of the system, **Regen Ledger accepts data from multiple sources linked to the same geographical location**, and has several layers of safeguards against bad data (whether it be falsely generated to game the system, or simply data from poorly calibrated or inaccurate sensors.)

The architecture of Regen Ledger is also built to continually incentivize better and more accurate data from multiple sources, and Regen Network as a whole aims to push the envelope on data collection in several key ways.

#### 2.3.1. Data Sources

Many **data sources** will be used to **verify claims of ecological state**. These include:

- Remote sensing data such as satellite and drone imagery
- IoT sensor data
- Public GIS datasets
- User-submitted data such as the soil testing units

More details are provided in the Regen Network Ecological State Protocols document.

#### 2.3.2. Data Schemas

**Shared data schemas** are required for the Regen Network ecosystem to function coherently.

Regen intends to build on the work of the W3C to create **globally namespaced identifiers** through efforts such as [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/), and on **open data efforts** in the agricultural space such as [GODAN](https://www.godan.info/). The aim is to support schema development that maximizes interoperability, semantic meaning, and the forward compatibility of identifiers in schemas that evolve over time.

#### 2.3.3. Data Integrity and Timestamping

In order to ensure the trustworthiness of user-collected data (whether it is public or private), users can submit a **content descriptor for data stored off-chain** that includes:
- The hash of the data
- A permanent URL from which to access it
- A geographic identifier tying it to a piece of land
- Metadata about the data stored at this URL

When this descriptor is submitted to the blockchain it will generate a **secure trusted timestamp** for the data. This timestamp together with the data's hash will ensure that data has not been manipulated since its collection date.

#### 2.3.4. Data Storage

Most raw data used in the system will be stored outside of Regen Ledger and tracked on the ledger as described above. Essentially, any data storage layer that can be referenced by HTTP could be used, such as IPFS.

Some users may want to keep their data private and hosted on a server they control. As long as the data hosting software implements the protocols necessary to make it accessible when needed for computations, it can be used as a storage layer. Specific integrations are planned for interfacing with data stored on Streamr and FarmOS.

#### 2.3.5. Data Quality Protocols (DQPs)

The **Data Quality Protocol (DQP) framework** allows for a structured way of **assessing the quality of input data** and can be used by the ESP framework as a way to filter input and/or qualify it with a confidence score.

DQPs may **correlate user-submitted data with implicitly trusted data sources** like public satellite imagery and use an **anomaly detector** to look for inconsistencies. DQPs may also take into account **user-submitted feedback** (i.e., ratings) on data sources.

#### 2.3.6. Data Marketplace

One ancillary function of Regen Ledger will be to **coordinate conditional access to network members' private data by other network members** possibly via a **fee system**.

**Data Access Protocols (DAPs)** allow users to create a **contract specifying the conditions under which they will grant access** to their data. This will effectively enable a data marketplace functionality on top of Regen Ledger.

### 2.4. Supporting Ledger Functionality

#### 2.4.1. Land Tenure Verification Protocol (LTVP)

One of the most difficult challenges in certifying or rewarding ecological change of state is **verifying that the party claiming a reward actually has land tenure
rights to the piece of land in question**.

To support a diverse array of verification providers, Regen Network will specify a **standard API**, called a **Land Tenure Verification Protocol (LTVP)**, for verification providers to implement in order for them to be referenced by ESPs and ECs.

Regen Foundation (described in more detail in the Governance section) will develop relationships with one or more third party verification providers and steward their implementation of this API to bootstrap the ecosystem.

#### 2.4.2. Token Issuance

It will be possible for **organizations to issue their own tokens** on top of Regen Ledger that allow new tokens to be minted when specific Ecological Contracts are fulfilled. Tokenizing living capital assets can be a way to bring value to whole watersheds or bioregions, or to tie value to the health of soil.

#### 2.4.3. Identity, Organizations, Key Management, and Arbitration

In order for other components of the system to function, Regen Ledger and its protocol frameworks will need to **address issues regarding identity, key management, organizational management, and arbitration** (in the case of disputes regarding Ecological Contracts for instance). Where possible, we will **leverage efforts by existing projects** in these spaces such as Sovrin for identity and key management or Aragon for arbitration.

### 2.5. End-User Applications

A number of **frontend apps** will be needed for the Regen Network ecosystem to flourish. Some of these may be existing applications such as FarmOS (which would provide data for ESPs), while others will be created from scratch to support the development, management, and fulfillment of ESPs, ECs, and SPs. It will be a **primary Regen Foundation function to support the development of these apps**.

## 3. Foundational Ecological State Protocols (ESPs)

**Regen Foundation** will create and steward a core set of open-source Ecological State Protocols (ESPs). While Regen Ledger is optimized for the purpose of verifying ecological outcomes, it can only actualize its potential with a flourishing ecosystem of protocols.

The core set of ESPs stewarded by the foundation will be developed by working groups of scientists, ecologists, farmers, and community members using an open source development process and open source license. This will allow the community to be actively engaged in the development process through public comment forums, public working group meetings and each ESP's issue tracker and merge request features. It will also allow the community to fork ESPs as necessary.

As more and more data is collected through the use of ESPs, this data will serve as input for the development of the next generation of ESPs, and as training data for associated machine learning algorithms.

Since the governance structure of the foundation gives Regen Consortium the responsibility to replace Regen Foundation's outgoing board directors, the long term maintenance of these core ESPs will effectively become a shared responsibility of the consortium. While the foundation and consortium will be stewarding this core set of ESPs, this effort will provide a template for other organizations to create ESPs suited to their needs and perspective, leading to an active, multi-stakeholder community working to further the state of ecological verification.

In the following sections, we propose several core protocols to be stewarded by the foundation, including a brief discussion of the rationale for each protocol and the proposed verification mechanisms. It should be kept in mind that each protocol can be used independently or in combination as an attestation of regenerative land use with various EC contracts to reward and incentivize change.

### 3.1. Carbon Sequestration Protocol

Earth's **soils** are the most important **carbon sink** available for the reduction of atmospheric CO2 levels via carbon sequestration. There are other larger carbon sinks available (such as oceans), but because soil is the basis of all agricultural output, none is so directly coupled with the human economy.

The single **most important indicator for determining carbon sequestration** is **Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)**. Carbon does not exist in its elementary form in nature and is encountered in soils as a complex chemical component. Therefore, SOC does not have specific spectral reflectance behavior and **cannot be measured directly** by remote sensing techniques. Instead, **measurement requires the use of parameters that link SOC and terrestrial surface reflectance**. Because Regen Network protocols rely on an entire network of information, the protocols will employ a threefold strategy for the estimation of SOC:

1. **Direct SOC measurements** performed by soil spectroscopy, lab tests, or the use of farm management software like FarmOS, which collects different user-provided information like soil color, farm practices, and sensor input.
2. **Various indicators as proxies for detecting an increase in SOC**. The initial pool of indicators proposed are:
  - Above Ground Biomass (AGB)
  - Land Conversion
  - Net Primary Production (NPP)
  - Biodiversity
  - Plant Functional Types (PFT) / Ellenberg Indicator Values
  - Soil Erosion
  - Nutrient and Water Runoff
  - Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)
  - Surface Water Quality
3. **SOC to be modeled using the newest remote sensing technologies**. Advanced spectral unmixing methods applied to the hyperspectral Hyperion data have given SOC fractions similar to those observed in the field.

**Improvements to protocol accuracy** aim to:
1. **Detect changes** in the local ecology linked to known carbon sequestration rates.
2. **Quantify the amount of carbon** sequestered in a given location.
3. **Link the sequestered carbon to the set of practices** that are directly correlated to the carbon drawdown (e.g., no-till agriculture, intercropping with perennials and trees, managed rotational grazing, compost application, etc.).

A proof of concept protocol is currently under development and more information on the indicators, algorithms, and method can be found in the Regen Network Ecological State Protocols document.

### 3.2. Other Proposed Ecological State Protocols (ESPs)

#### 3.2.1. Grassland Health and Grazing Patterns Protocol

**Grasslands** cover approximately **3.5 billion hectares** (26% of global ice-free land area and 70% of global agricultural area, containing about 20% of the world's SOC stocks). About 7.5% of worldwide grasslands have been degraded because of overgrazing. Regular monitoring at national and global scales is necessary for maintaining awareness of changes in natural and cultivated areas.

Using **geospatial data**, the grassland open verification protocol will analyze grasslands for their ecological value and assess different ecological characteristics such as **biomass estimation**, **carbon sequestration**, **species diversity**, and **land use patterns**.

An intended outcome of this open verification protocol is the incentivization of rotational grazing and holistic management practices to regenerate and restore degraded grassland. Conversations have begun with Savory Institute to work towards adapting or building on their existing Ecological Outcome Verification system.

#### 3.2.2. Blue Carbon Protocol (BCP)

Naturally occurring and artificial **coastal wetland ecosystems** are critical for biodiversity and broad ecosystemic health. Wetland soils contain some of the highest stores of SOC in the biosphere and coastal wetlands tend to have exceptionally large carbon stocks. Their protection and restoration would constitute an effective mitigation strategy to climate change. The BCP would **ensure inclusion of wetland ecosystems in mitigation strategies** and **deliver accurate carbon accounting** in coastal areas.

Wetlands are transitional zones between water and terrestrial environments. Wetland ecosystems are also seasonal and have high inter-annual fluctuations. By observing or processing satellite images over time, it is possible to monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of the plant biomass production in a wetland ecosystem in a given year. This protocol will **map surface open water and vegetation**, and **assess the state of the connectivity of these landscapes**. The BCP could also **compare year by year land cover and boundary changes**. Data collected over longer time-frames is capable of determining trends and the magnitude of these trends, like deposition or erosion in river deltas and wetland habitats. Using multi-temporal data analysis of high resolution imagery coupled with landscape spatial analysis in GIS, it is possible to **distinguish between anthropogenic and climatic causes of wetland aerial changes** and **map the vegetation species composition of an area** of interest with a high level of accuracy.

Thus, by having **a BCP that maps and measures water quality and pollution**, **analyzes the distribution and dynamics of coastal vegetation**, and **applies impact predictions of certain disturbances**, it becomes possible to **verify coastal ecological outcomes using GIS, satellite data, and smart water quality monitoring systems**. Integrating ECs with the BCPs unlocks the potential for ecological rewards as described in the SOC section above.

For example, it now may be financially viable to shift from the monoculture chemical intensive practices of brackish shrimp farming, and regrow complex and biodiverse mangrove fisheries. Additionally, rewards for ecosystem improvements can be coupled with ECs and SPs to create a multi-layered, multi-stakeholder approach to ensure economic viability and reward ecological regeneration.

#### 3.2.3. Adoption of Regenerative Agricultural Practices Protocol (RAPP)

While **agriculture** is responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it also holds incredible **potential as a net-carbon sink**. **Regenerative agriculture practices** aim to reverse climate change by **capturing carbon in soil and aboveground biomass**. Regenerative agriculture increases functional biodiversity, enriches soil quality, improves water cycling, and enhances all major ecosystem services. This results in increased yields, resilience to climate instability, and higher overall health and vitality for farming communities.

The **RAPP** employs a set of **peer-reviewed ecosystem functions linked to regenerative agricultural practices**. The protocol requires high definition **satellite data**, real-time **ecological monitoring**, and **verified user input** as its main sources for verification. This protocol can then be **used by many ECs to incentivize a shift in agricultural practices**.

#### 3.2.4. Methane Emissions Protocol (MEP)

**Methane** is one of the GHGs with the greatest impact. Anthropogenic methane emissions are primarily caused by landfills, rice cultivation, livestock, biomass burning, coal mining, tundra melt, peatland destruction, and gas supply and flaring. In October 2018, level 2 products of the Sentinel 5-p satellite on methane emissions became available to the public through the **Copernicus open access hub**. The Sentinel 5-p uses the TROPOMI (passive grating imaging) instrument, which has a spatial sampling resolution of 7x7 km² and 4 separate detectors. This **sensor** is able to detect geolocated columns of ozone sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, and methane as well as geolocated aerosol and cloud formation. By developing the **methane emissions protocol** to ensure compatibility with the newest Sentinel 5-p data products and integrating in-situ measurements that are able to decipher the distinct chemical fingerprints of a variety of methane sources, the **MEP will both visualize and predict alterations in methane emissions**.

One of the goals of the MEP will be to **encourage and verify reduced flooding in rice paddies** in order to curtail the large amounts of methane emitted due to anaerobic digestion. This is a powerful example of a SP where monitoring and verifying ecological improvement becomes an element of both a multistakeholder initiative to shift farming practices as well as a brand story. Lotus Foods, a US rice brand is already taking leadership on this front, and would benefit greatly from trusted protocols and blockchain for verifying the methane specific ecological outcomes and, in telling this story through their branding and marketing, can offer added value to their customers and industry.

_Additional protocols can be found in the Regen Network Ecological State Protocols document._

## 4. Market

Regen Network will open up a new economic paradigm in which **markets** are **able to appropriately incorporate ecological health**. The ability to tokenize the information and data layer of this ecological ledger is key for functionality, but the larger disruptive potential of this new economic paradigm that is being ushered in by blockchain is the **tokenization of specific living ecological capital assets**.

The market section of **this document explores four existing markets** that will be fundamentally transformed by the ability to access verifiable ecological data and incorporate this data into Regen Ledger's smart contacting framework to create ecological contracts.

### 4.1. Economic Model

There are **three key mechanisms** core to Regen Network's ability to reroute a trajectory towards a livable planet for future generations:
- **Rewarding** regenerative **ecological outcomes**.
- **Incentivizing** accurate **ecological data** to be produced and shared.
- **Open source technological development** aimed at **ecological and agricultural applications** in blockchain, remote sensing, IoT, machine learning, and fintech.

### 4.2. Application

The strength of a cryptographic network providing common utility is defined by the applications built on top of it. This section explores the applications that may be built on top of Regen Ledger's Ecological State Protocols (ESPs), Ecological Contracts (ECs), and Supply Protocol (SP) described earlier.

#### 4.2.1. Carbon Market Case Study

**Carbon markets** currently exist as a way to help reduce the emissions of carbon and other greenhouse gases. The Paris Climate Agreement attempts to set a 2º C maximum global temperature rise ceiling due to climate change and sets an internationally accepted goal at 1.5º C. As there has already been 1º C of warming, such goals are extremely ambitious and will require not just cuts in emissions but active drawdown. The IFC‘s Climate Investment Opportunities Report, released in November 2016, identified $23 trillion in investment opportunities in emerging markets by 2030. Carbon markets represent one key pathway towards these ends within which there are **two types**:

- **Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM).** These are primarily utilized by **corporations aiming to offset carbon emissions**. The voluntary market is estimated to be **$191 million in volume in 2016**. There is a **surplus of carbon credits in the market** and **price varies** depending on the type of activity, location, age, standard, etc; not all credits are considered equal. The most-transacted project types by volume in 2016 were: REDD+, wind, landfill methane, large hydropower, and community-focused energy efficiency.
- **Compliance Carbon Markets (CCM).** These are **cap-and-trade markets** set up by signatories of the Kyoto Protocol, and had a market volume of **$57 billion in 2015**. Compliance Carbon Markets are **much more heavily regulated** where entities exchange emission allowances to meet predetermined regulatory targets. Reductions are **imposed by public authorities and regulators** with high penalties for non-compliance.

Many of the credits popular in the **voluntary markets** have been criticized as being **weak in impact**. Carbon credits are issued for avoided deforestation and the installation of solar panels. With current accounting methods, credits are **often double-counted**, sometimes repeatedly. This is fundamentally different than a net positive or carbon drawdown effect. In other cases, there have been **little to no penalties when outcomes are not reached**. The provenance of ecological outcomes traded in the marketplace matters.

In application, **Regen Network** provides **three major upgrades for carbon markets**:
1. **Automation** could significantly **reduce verification overhead** by using a **technology-driven model as part of the certification process**. This decentralized and cost-efficient process could allow a significant population of farmers previously not able to participate in the carbon markets to join in. According to Nori, a blockchain-powered drawdown carbon marketplace, carbon credits traditionally have an **overhead of 40-60% of the sales price**, with the remainder going to the outcome.
2. **Outcome results will be more precise and trustable** in their relation to **actual carbon levels**. With a decentralized and self governed blockchain that is able to verify carbon in an open and transparent way, all verified outcomes will be recorded in a public ledger.
3. **Activities currently being verified** as carbon credits **will be challenged** and a **market for superior drawdown credits** will be created. It will also have the added benefit of organizing communities, improving land steward/farmer livelihoods, and creating healthier soils.

#### 4.2.2. Risk Mitigation Case Study

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2017 was a record-breaking year in terms of both the number and cost of **weather and climate disasters**, with 16 separate disaster events causing **$306.2 billion dollars in damage**.

As this climate instability intensifies, private institutions such as banks and insurance companies will need to find creative ways to **hedge exposure to these risks** and **increase resilience of the communities** with whom they are engaged. Many of these natural disasters will be unavoidable and ultimately increase the cost of doing business to a new normal. From the physical buildings where companies (and employees) reside, to active risk mitigation in portfolio management, a local understanding of **regenerative practices can support ecosystem health**.

**Regen Ledger** can be used as a **preventive tool in the face of natural disasters**. At-risk industries like financial services (and communities at large) can rally together to **restore health to local bioregions and reduce the cost of damages**. By pledging rewards in Ecological Contracts to achieve specific ecological outcomes in their coverage areas, exposure can be quantifiably reduced. This use of the reward function of an Ecological Contract is only one way insurance companies can use smart contracting mechanisms to mitigate expense and maximize protection of clients. More complex data sets combined with Ecological Contracts also open up the possibility of reduced premiums for particular actions that reduce community risk in an area.

#### 4.2.3. Supply Certifications Case Study

The market for goods and services focused on health, the environment, social justice, personal development and sustainable living—has an estimated size of $290 billion. This consumer base has grown to reach 13-19% of US adults, nearly 41 million people who trust **certifications** like Organic, B Corp, USDA, Fair Trade USA, and Rainforest Alliance to guide their purchasing of products that support their ecological and social values. Given their unique capacity, skill sets, and supply systems, **companies like Patagonia and Starbucks have elected to create their own standards**. These standards are often nuanced and difficult to decipher for the average consumer.

**Regenerative Agriculture** is trending as the new gold standard. You can find the term showcased at the largest natural and organic consumer packaged goods trade show events in the world, and leading edge companies are in the process of adopting regenerative agriculture into their supply systems and/or have created regenerative agriculture departments within their companies. As we become more connected to where our products come from and the impact of their production in the wake of climate change effects, these standards will become more valuable.

In application, Regen Ledger‘s smart contracting framework can provide several **upgrades to supply system certifications** and the overall consumer experience. Using the integrated framework of Ecological State Protocols (ESPs) and Data Quality Protocols (DQPs), costly **verification systems can become more transparent, precise, and efficient**. This creates the potential for disintermediation in the market and improvement to methodologies as the public compares existing opaque systems, with the transparent, easily verifiable open source systems provided by Regen Network.

Credibility will be maintained as meaningful due to **community participation in both verification and standard setting**. Consumers will also be able to engage with products in unprecedented ways. Since rewards can be staked in token markets, consumers will be able to filter products based on carbon drawdown and even earn tokens themselves by engaging in local land data verification methods.

Regen Consortium and the Community Staking Pools' governance model lends itself well to certification organizations joining to utilize the power of Regen Ledger and global database to lower the cost and increase the quality of their certification processes, and perhaps even transcend the older compliance model with a newer direct connection to trusted participation through a democratically governed, distributed trust layer.

#### 4.2.4. Farmer Software and Data Exchange Case Study

Globally, **food and agriculture** is a **$7.8 trillion industry**, responsible for feeding the planet and hiring well over 40% of it. According to the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), there are an estimated 500 million smallholder farmers worldwide producing about 80% of the food.

One **legacy issue** between farmers and agri-food tech companies has been **ownership and control of data**. Big profits from these agri-businesses does not necessarily trickle down to the farmers. This has remained an ambiguous gray area and source of tension for most companies trying to forge these relationships with farmers who have too often been taken advantage of in the past. The result has been the emergence of open sources companies like Farmer Business Network and FarmOS; NGOs like Open Ag Data Alliance; and government data exchanges like Data.gov/food dedicated to farmer data privacy, control, and empowerment. These renewed commitments to farmer empowerment and control are an important aspect of upgrading the current agricultural system.

Currently, **most of the world's farmers are struggling to compete** in an economy that undervalues what they do and asks them to produce the highest quantity at the lowest price. This **extractive model** has led to the degradation of soils, the poisoning of our waterways, the loss of community resiliency, the de-nutrification of our food, and a culture disconnected from healthy food systems and the planet.

**Regen Network** provides a great deal of **value that can be integrated with existing agritech farmer decision-making platforms as well as custom end-user applications**. Farmers will be able to access supplemental income by taking advantage of the capacity of their land to solicit **Ecological Contract rewards** placed by committed individuals, corporations, and governments. Additionally, the sheer amount of **farmer-owned and controlled data** available on the system will be extremely valuable in and of itself. The timestamped data index and data access protocols of Regen Ledger effectively create a **data marketplace** that allows farmer data to be bought and sold. This data could be queried via a custom DApp and/or integrated into existing agri-tech platforms. Investors interested in drawdown can locate and support farmers without the ability to regenerate their land financially or technically. Those farmers with the interest and land capacity can engage in smart contracts to split the rewards in a cooperative effort to increase livelihoods, drawdown carbon, and improve ecosystem health - all with the bonus of higher crop yields and reduced management costs.

## 5. Governance

In order to fulfill the mandate set out in its mission, Regen Network will pursue three **concurrent areas of activity**:
1. The **development and launch of a distributed ledger** specifically tuned to support the verification of ecological outcomes, incentivization of positive ecological outcomes, supply system tracking, and related functionality.
2. The **development of protocols for the verification** of ecological outcomes.
3. Ongoing **engagement with and support of the emergent movements** surrounding regenerative agriculture, ecological land/water/air stewardship, and alternative economics.

At the heart of Regen Network will be a **native network token called Regen Token ($REGEN)**. Regen Tokens will run natively on Regen Ledger. This token will allow for **staking on validators** to secure the network, **access to trusted data fueling protocols** and **end-user applications**, and be **used to reward ecological outcomes**.

To **support the development** of the Regen Ledger, various protocols, and development of the $REGEN, **Regen Network Development, Inc. (RND), a Delaware C-Corp**, will issue **Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFTs)**.

**RND** will develop the **Regen Ledger and $REGEN token**, with the understanding that **RND will donate certain assets and intellectual property rights to Regen Foundation** when advisable from a legal, tax, accounting, and business perspective.

### 5.1. Regen Foundation

**Regen Foundation** is a Delaware **non-stock corporation** applying to become a **federal 501(c)(3) public charity**, created to support the growth of Regen Network and develop and maintain Regen Ledger software, associated compute infrastructure, key protocols, and frontend apps for achieving and rewarding ecological regeneration.

### 5.2. Foundation Governance

Regen Foundation will have a **board of five directors** (two internal, and three external) to be **appointed by the founding team** of Regen Network.

Beginning **three years after the formation** of the legal entity, **a board seat will come up for appointment each year**, so that the board will have **full turnover by year eight**. External seats will come up for appointment first. From year three forward, board seats will have a five year term. Appointments from year three forward will be **determined by Regen Consortium** (Consortium), which will be comprised of the members of the Foundation.

Specific **responsibilites of Regen Foundation in relation to the Consortium** will be:
- Convening a **yearly gathering of Consortium members** and other members of the larger Regen Network community (data providers, farmers, user groups, developers, etc.).
- **Granting and investing** in businesses, non-profits, or independent initiatives that further the aforementioned aims.
- **Providing software interfaces** for network transparency and consortium voting.
- **Growing the consortium** of trusted organizations around the world working in the domain of ecological monitoring, regeneration, and data science.

Once created, **Regen Ledger will be governed autonomously by $REGEN token holders**, including Regen Consortium. At this stage, Regen Ledger will be a public blockchain. Regen Ledger is an a-legal entity, meaning that even if something happens to Regen Foundation, Regen Ledger will be able to continue to operate as a censorship resistant record of ecological health and platform for ecological agreements under the stewardship of Regen Ledger's network of validator nodes and token holders. This structure creates a firewall between the Foundation and Ledger to ensure that the mission will be seen out in the face of a range of possible challenges.

### 5.3. Foundation Entity Type: US 501(c)(3)

Regen Foundation is a Delaware non-stock corporation, and will be applying for US 501(c)(3) status as a public charity. There are three main reasons behind the choice:
1. **Securities Laws:** Many other projects in the crypto and blockchain space pursuing the issuance of utility tokens hoping to avoid US securities laws have shied away from US jurisdiction. We believe there is a need to be clear with our early backers that the token, at the stage of issuance via a SAFT, is indeed a security, even though as the system matures we believe the token will evolve into what should most appropriately be considered a commodity. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission will maintain jurisdiction over securities investors operating from and within the US. A foreign domicile doesn't necessarily offer better protection if US contributors are involved.
2. **Corporate Governance:** In order for Regen Network as a whole to succeed, Regen Ledger must be adopted and governed by institutional organizational stakeholders. This application of blockchain is an innovation to existing market and governance mechanisms and must be understandable and trusted by our stakeholders; the 501(c)(3) structure can serve as a bridge between these paradigms. There are many examples of comparable public-benefit entities that maintain infrastructure that are already recognized by the IRS, which lead us to believe that our application also warrants charitable status. We wish to maintain explicit and democratic governance over this infrastructure, both on and off chain.
3. **US-Centric Team:** Although Regen Network will be a global project, and already has a team distributed around the world, the founders of the project are mostly US citizens. This means that the project will need to comply with US law, so we deem it to be more efficient to simply use the US as the jurisdiction of choice.

### 5.4. Overview of Regen Consortium

**Regen Consortium** is the **group of organizations governing 5 million $REGEN**, permanently locked and staked to secure Regen Ledger. Locking, in this case, is a technical term in the Cosmos SDK which means that the tokens can be staked with a validator, and the tokens can vote on network upgrades, but they cannot be exchanged to a new address. This enables us to maintain **at least 35% voting power in locked governance DAOs** with unique characteristics to optimize for community engagement in the governance of the blockchain and platform (read more on these DAO in the Community Staking Pools section below).

The **initial Consortium members will be invited by Regen Foundation**, and from that point forward this body will be self-governing. Regen Consortium enables an unprecedented democratic and cooperative movement to be built around growing institutional capacity to account for ecological health in decision making and reward increases in ecological health. Many Proof-of-Stake blockchains lack the ability to incorporate non-token-holding stakeholders and users into the governance of the Blockchain. To optimally serve the interests of users who are working together for ecological health outcomes it is clear that the distinct communities of users who may be unable to purchase tokens as a prerequisite for participation in governance should still have a seat at the proverbial table.

The **Consortium/Community Staking Pools model has two major benefits** in this application:
1. Authority over just over 1/3 of the votes needed for consensus will be held by known actors, which we believe will be beneficial for the health, security, and growth of the network.
2. This enables organizations to participate in governing the blockchain they use to help track ecological health and issue direct rewards for increases in ecological health that benefit their communities.

Consortium members will be organizations with expertise and leadership in the domains of the platform: regenerative agriculture, remote sensing, circular economy, ecology, earth systems, blockchain, and regenerative economics.

_For further information on the Consortium membership process, the removal process for Consortium members, and the governance and consensus mechanism, read the full Regen Network Whitepaper (sections 5.4.1, 5.4.2, and 5.4.3)._

### 5.5. Community Staking Pools

**30 million $REGEN** will be placed in the **Community Staking Pool** at genesis block, split between no less than three constituency groups.

**Criteria** for a **constituency DAO formation** (taking over keys):
- Signed by no less than 10 addresses that are verified by Regen Foundation and the Validator Set.
- KYC/AML: Organization in good standing in approved legal jurisdiction of incorporation (list pending).
- Ratify a statement of fiduciary responsibility for ecosystem health clause in corporate bylaws of organization of signer.
- Exclusive use of network through DAO Agreement: The organization must sign a legal document stating that they do not and will not personally hold or manage any $REGEN for any reason (e.g. that they will restrict their interactions with the network through the DAO that they belong to and manage). Note: if this is discovered to not be true, this organization will be removed from the constituency governance DAO by vote of the DAO.
- Drafting and adoption of DAO operating agreements.
- Legal reflection of DAO operating structure: DAO must be incorporated in appropriate legal jurisdiction and have contracts with Regen Foundation outlining the appropriate responsibilities and rights.

Like any staked entity on the network, a DAO can both be slashed and will earn block rewards and fees and can vote on what to do with those fees ensures that this community is deeply aligned with the shared value generation of the network.

Before these DAOs have come online, the Foundation will steward these token pools by delegations to approved validators. The approval process of these validators will follow a strict selection process which will prioritize: 
- Security and competency of operation (no delegations will be allowed to operators running purely cloud-based set ups)
- Rating of support of bootstrapping the network (performance in test nets and longevity of testnet participation)
- istribution of stake to ensure diversification security

_For further information on the background of the governance design choices made, read the full Regen Network Whitepaper (section 5.6)._

### 5.7. Token Sale and Development

Since its conception in 2016, Regen Network has been incubated by a regenerative supply consultancy, **Terra Genesis International, LLC (TGI)**. In order to have the leeway to issue team token allocations, reimburse TGI for startup costs, and because running a token sale out of a non-profit has considerable legal uncertainty, initial SAFTs will be signed with Regen Network Development, Inc., a Delaware C-Corp. Proceeds will, in part, be utilized for the development of Regen Network.
