## Values
- **Radical purpose:** Doing what is right is at the core. Speaking and acting with candid care and purpose. Feedback is sharp, yet thoughtful.
- **Open:** Building in the open and with others. Productively stewarding key DAO ecosystem primitives while leveraging existing building blocks.
- **Collaborative:** Doing everything as a team. This practically means being on calls across teams, and communicating across distances. We are shared owners who are responsible to each other.
- **Adaptive:** Being action-oriented, experimental, and creator-minded. Web3 changes fast: we should too.
- **Accommodative:** Willing to help, forgive mistakes, and welcome others. Good collaborators ask without assuming and seek understanding without judgment. If we canâ€™t do this, wngmi.
- **Knowledge sharing:** We aim to extend our knowledge to the network and are fundamentally curious about the world around us.
