# PrimeDAO

**PrimeDAO** provides decentralized, participatory, human-centric, and impact-focused infrastructure and tools for cross-DAO coordination.

## Prime dApps

### [Prime Launch](prime-dapps/prime-launch.md)

**Prime Launch** is the incubator for new DAOs. With Launch, projects offer their DAO token in exchange for other tokens, such as stablecoins. Launch provides a plethora of configurability and compliance options for DAOs to utilize in their token offering.

### [Prime Deals](prime-dapps/prime-deals.md)

**Prime Deals** is the negotiation interface for DAOs. DAOs can utilize Prime Deals to start, ratify, and archive negotiations and execute on-chain deals such as token swaps, joint ventures, co-liquidity provision, and farming.

### [Prime Pools](prime-dapps/prime-pools.md)

**Prime Pools** is where DAOs can grow and manage their on-chain liquidity, by either providing growth incentives or governing the parameters of their liquidity pools.

### [Prime Rating](prime-dapps/prime-rating.md)

**Prime Rating** is a light rating interface for both retail and institutional players to get their feet wet in the DAO ecosystem.

### [Proposal Inverter](prime-dapps/proposal-inverter.md)

The **proposal inverter** is a primitive for funding public goods, allowing DAOs to pool resources and co-fund open research/crowdfunded initiatives through semi-automated payment flows.

2. Understand the contributor guidelines
3. Fill out [this form](https://primedao.typeform.com/to/I5Xk9e6g) to tell Prime contributors about yourself

6. Schedule an on-boarding call with workstream leads

PrimeDao supports two type of roles for its various contributors and ecosystem members:

- **Contributor:** Active role, part of the DAO's builder collective, creating value through labor. Contributors vote and propose to the DAO. A vast range of contributors exist beyond developers: architects, researchers, designers, product experts, auditors, operations personnel, marketing and communications staff, ecosystem facilitators, devOps, recruiters, legal, project managers, copywriters...
- **Ambassador:** Passive role, part of the DAO's voter assembly, creating value by discussing and voting on proposals submitted by contributors. Ambassadors are generally available for consultation and advisory to help contributors solve problems they may face in their proposals.

### Prime Development Cycles

PrimeDAO's development is organized into work cycles of 2-3 month sprints, usually starting at the beginning of each quarter.

- **At the beginning of a cycle**, governance is undertaken to allocate funding to squads for the purposes of executing on proposals.
- **Mid-cycle,** governance and work proposals should generally not be submitted to avoid governance fatigue. This is the time period in which squads are expected to be focused on delivering their proposals.
- **At the end of a cycle**, self-reporting is expected by squads and workers from the previous cycle explaining the work completed and work yet-to-be completed; this is a form of self-accountability.

### Compensation

- **Contributor 0**.
  - **Mission:** Get acquainted with PrimeDAO products, know the community better. Understand if you are interested to stay and continuing your journey as a contributor or being a guest/visitor.
  - **Actions:** Start a Notion page/profile, participate and be present in calls, take notes.
  - **Support:** Every week you'll get an email with ideas on how to explore PrimeDAO. New contributor calls are held every 2 weeks, where you can ask questions or share your experience at Prime.
  - **Cycle:** 2 weeks to 1 month.
  - **Rewards:** Knowledge.
- **Contributor 1** Bounties.
  - **Mission:** Build! Take initiative, be proactive, act. Find out how comfortable it is for you to be on the building site with other contributors.
  - **Actions:** Form your rep portfolio (Notion page) by documenting tasks you've completed and calls you have attended.
  - **Cycle:** 1 to 2 months.
  - **Support:** Prime buddy - someone you'll do your tasks with.
  - **Rewards:** Bounties.
- **Contributor 2:** Monthly reward based on contribution, where a full-time active contributor can get up to $2500. To become a Contributor 2 you need to submit a proposal 2 weeks ahead of the beginning of a new cycle. In these 2 weeks, PrimeDAO forms the budget for the upcoming quarter.

## Governance and Operations

### Communication Channels

Besides the public Discord and Telegram groups, there are **private channels** where squads and contributing teams work through outstanding issues:

- **Prime Strategy:** Group of veteran workers and squad leaders from Prime who work on operations and strategy for the DAO.
- **Working Groups:** Projects like Prime's D2D interface have private WGs where DAO members self-organize, communicate, and execute on the work.
- **Partner Groups:** These exist for projects that are heavily reliant on other technology stacks (like Prime Pools with Balancer) and have direct partner chats that are used to troubleshoot development and work towards enhanced cooperation in a small group setting.

### Squad Driven Development

Squad-driven development can be alternatively understood as a "federated DAO", with squads typically segmented by entity and at times by competency.

Squads ensure that contributors don't work in isolation, which often leads to wasted work hours and a lack of information flow. They help keep contributors accountable to each other, and have better collective memory than individuals.

Soon-to-be contributors should ask themselves whether they'd like to work in DAO-to-DAO mechanisms, governance, Prime Launch, Prime Pools, Prime Rating, Prime Deals, or ecosystem building in general.
