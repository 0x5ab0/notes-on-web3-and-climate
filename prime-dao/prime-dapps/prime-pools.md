# Prime Pools

**Prime Pools** are DAO-governed liquidity pools that bridge liquidity between allied ecosystems and create index pools.

Prime Pools builds on the innovative momentum of the LP Manager, a [DAOstack](http://daostack.io/) plugin that allows PrimeDAO to govern Smart Pools on the Balancer Protocol, by further enabling collaboration and alliance between DAOs.

Prime Pools are built using the Balancer Protocol. By integrating governance functionalities to these Smart Pools, Prime Pools achieve automated and adaptive economic management for Prime’s ecosystem. Collective co-governance of the pool allows Prime REP holders to enact policies and set economic parameters that are equitable, aligned, and representative of the community’s preferences.

Prime Pools are integral to how various projects within the Prime ecosystem will work with one another, let alone the ecosystem as a whole. Prime Pools can create value-alignment between DAO ecosystems through co-liquidity provision, mutual skin-in-the-game, and co-farming.

Through Prime Pools, PrimeDAO is able to bring forth a Prime DeFi Index, composed of safe DeFi protocols with the highest Prime Rating.
