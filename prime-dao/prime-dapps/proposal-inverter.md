# Proposal Inverter

The **Proposal Inverter** is a funding primitive that enables mutliple groups or individuals to collaborate on common proposals.

It "inverts" the DAO-proposal relationship such that, instead of having many proposals attributed to a single DAO, multiple DAOs can work collaboratively on a single proposal.

This enables the collaborative funding of proposals that benefit multiple DAOs throghout the ecosystem. This can be thought of as solving the byzantine generals' problem for the collective funding of public goods for DAOs.

Ultimately, it is proposed as a lower overhead funding mechanism for continuous work that delivers shared benefits to multiple groups.
